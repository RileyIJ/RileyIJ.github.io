      <p>So I made a website, and you’re there now. This is something I’ve been meaning to do for a while now for a couple of resons: </p>
<p>Firstly, this will act as a sort of portfolio for me as an electrical engineer. I’ll use it to show off my knowledge and skills so everyone can know what a kick-ass engineer I am. </p>
<p>Secondly and more importantly, I’ve been wanting a creative outlet of sorts. I’ve been meaning to start some projects outside of university to flex some of my hard skills and apply my knowledge. I’ve got quite a few idea that I want to explore and projects that I would like to try out, ranging from making a pair of smart(ish) glasses to some coding adventures. I’ve been really inspired by the likes of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/williamosman">William Osman</a>, Shane Wighton of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/StuffMadeHere">Stuff Made Here</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SebastianLague">Sebastion Lague</a>. Sebastion Lague in particular has a series called coding adventures that I absolutely love, wherein he explores implementing a variety of topics into code for games or little simultions. At some point, I’d like to try and do something similar to what he does using unity and C# so hopefully you’ll see something like that in the next couple months. </p>

<h3 id="How-did-I-make-this-site"><a href="#How-did-I-make-this-site" class="headerlink" title="How did I make this site?"></a>How did I make this site?</h3><p>It was actually surprisingly easy to get this up and running, although my initial attempts were a bit misguided. </p>
<p>In my past semester I did an engineering unit called ‘Engineering Mobile Apps’ (unit code ENG1003 for anyone interested, though the unit is now discontinued) which revolved around creating web apps for a variety of applications using HTML and Javascript. This wasn’t my first into coding as I has already done a unit of introductory python, but it was my first time using javascript and HTML. To be completely honest it was a terrible introduction to coding in general, they rushed through things and if I hadn’t already been relatively confident with python I would’ve really struggled. That aside, I figured that since this units main assessments involved building basic websites I figured I would be able to handle making a basic blog from scratch. </p>
<p>Boy was I wrong</p>
<p>The amount of time and effort that I require to make something that looks like absolute ass was simply not worth it. ended up with a half decent home page and contact page, but then I realised that I didn’t really know how to handle actually making a blog. My plan was to write my blog posts in word, and then used some javascript to extract it and format it into html that could be displayed. Just the thought of attacking this problem made me ready to give up, so I pretty quickly did.</p>
<p>At christmas time, my brother who works building web apps came to visit and I told him of my woes. He pointed me towards <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.11ty.dev/">eleventy</a> and the idea was immediately very appealing to me. Something that could do 95% of the owrk for me? sign me up! but for some reason eleventy rubbed me the wrong way so I started looking for some alternatives and quickly found <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a>. I followed a great tutorial by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GiraffeAcademy">Mike Dane</a> to learn the basics of Hexo and generate the site and bing bang bong - from there I could start writing blog posts. Now to get it online.</p>
<h3 id="Getting-it-online"><a href="#Getting-it-online" class="headerlink" title="Getting it online"></a>Getting it online</h3><p>I have an old Raspberry Pi 2 lying around from a kids computer kit that my brother gifted to me and my siblings many years ago, and the original plan was to make use this to host the site. It might have been a little slow, but it would’ve got the job done. However, I live on res at Monash uni which means I use the Monash wifi. For obvious reasons Monash isn’t the biggest fan of students hosting web servers on their bandwith, so the Raspberry Pi was out. On the bright side, its now free for me to use in a project somewhere else, so you might see it appear in a project later down the track.</p>
<p>Next I started looking into what options I had available for paid site hosting. Generally speaking the options were actually realtively affordable, however since I’m a poor ass uni student and I wasn’t (and still arent) sure if I would actually follow through with this whole thing the thought of throwing $100 or more at a hosting service for a year of up time wasn’t the most appealing. </p>
<p>I pretty much gave up at this point, figured I’d revisit this when I had a bit more time, more experience, more money, and access to my own network. But one day I was watching a video by Sebastion Lague (hey, that guy again!) about how he made a game based on a prompt given by a game idea generator (which he also made). The game itself is unimportant, but what is important is that he put the idea generator up on a website which he hosted with (<em>drum roll please</em>)…</p>
<h4 id="Github-pages"><a href="#Github-pages" class="headerlink" title="Github pages"></a><em><strong>Github pages</strong></em></h4><p>and voila, heres the solution to my problem! Completely free, customisable site hosting all with my own domain name! As much as I had my heart set on the domain name ‘rileyisaiah.com’, I am perfectly happy with rileyisaiah.github.io. I am still amazed by the number of completely free tools and services there are on the internet. Everything I have used to get this working has been completely free and could be done by just about anyone, all it takes is a bit of time and effort. </p>

<p>Thanks for reading! I hope you enjoy everything to come!</p>
